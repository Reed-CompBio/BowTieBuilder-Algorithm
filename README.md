# BowTieBuilder-Algorithm
This repository contains an implementation of the BowTieBuilder Algorithm.

# BowTieBuilder Docker image

A simple pathway reconstruction algorithm used to welcome new contributors. The algorithm takes a network and 2 lists of nodes (source and target sets) as input. It outputs all edges in the network that are shortest paths from source to target sets. (...)

New contributors complete the Dockerfile to wrap the implementation in btb.py.

# Usage 
Implemented into the Signaling Pathway Reconstruction Streamliner [(SPRAS)](https://github.com/Reed-CompBio/spras).
